# Landslide-Residual-Vegetation-Predictions
Welcome.  This site contains:
A dataset of landslide characteristics, 
A Python program (iynb format) for using the sklearn Support Vector Machine binary classifier (Github_AI_0_SVM_Accuracies_Predictions.ipynb).  The program has two code blocks.  The first one loads and formats the raw data on landslide characteristics.  The second runs the SVM classifier a user-specified number of times, with each run using a different pseudorandom state (from 0 to the user-specified number).  I used from between 20 and 100 in my analyses; the final residual vegetation predictions were made using 100 runs.  
Then, to view the prediction scores can be viewed using Github_AI_1_Make_Predictions.ipynb
